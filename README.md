# CDR Data Analysis Package (Standard Version)
This is a set of software/tools for analysis of CDR (Call Detail Record) Data including anonymization, pre-processing, interpolation and visualization. 

**This repositoty is being update, some modules might not be available yet, keep checking!**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the software package and running on your local machine. It can be run on both Windows and Mac as the software was developed by Java.
